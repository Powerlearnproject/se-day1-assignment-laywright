# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software.
1. Improves efficiency
2. Facilitaes scalability
3. Enhances security
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. development of programming languages
2. the establishment of software engineering as a discipline
3. the advent of structured programming in the 1970s
4. the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.  Requirements
2.  Design
3.  Implementation
4.  Testing
5.  Deployment
6.  Maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. It is rigid, with minimal flexibility for changes. Best for projects with fixed requirements, such as government contracts or compliance-heavy software.
  
  Agile is iterative and flexible, with work divided into sprints for continuous improvement. It allows frequent customer feedback and adapts to changing requirements. Best for dynamic projects like mobile app development or AI-based applications.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (Visual Studio, Jupiter notebook).
Version Control Systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines
Technical debt
How to solve 
effective communication,
agile methodologies, 
prioritization of task


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Unit Testing testing individual components or modules of software.
 Integration Testing for testing the interactions between different components or subsystems
 System Testing for testing the entire software system as a whole.
 Acceptance Testing for testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective prompts to optimize the responses generated by AI models. It involves structuring queries, using specific keywords, and refining language to achieve accurate, relevant, and context-aware outputs.

1. Improves Efficiency  and reduces the need for multiple iterations by guiding AI toward the desired output.
2. Expands AI Capabilities that enables AI to perform complex tasks like summarization, coding, and creative writing effectively.
3. minimizes Bias and Errors

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague :Tell me about mountains in kenya
Improved: Give me a brief history of the mountains in Kenya, How they got their names and also where they are located and what I might experience when I visit the place.
